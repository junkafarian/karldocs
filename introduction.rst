KARL Introduction
=================

KARL is a project designed to provide knowledge management and community centred collaboration tools.

It provides some comprehensive (yet somewhat targetted) functionality. In place of providing a framework approach to functionality, it provides a number of entry points which can be used to override / selectively include this functionality.

This package is designed to provide a barebones implementation of a package used to control KARL. It is used for illustrative purposes through the `KARL Documentation <http://dev.karlproject.org/>`_ and defines some default data including users and an example ``Office``.
